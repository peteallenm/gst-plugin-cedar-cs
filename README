GStreamer 1.0 plugin for Cedar h264 hardware encoding using the closed source library

Based on the non-binary blob version https://github.com/gtalusan/gst-plugin-cedar which is excellent, but doesn't support constant bitrate.

Usage:

gst-launch -ve videotestsrc ! cedar_h264enc ! h264parse ! matroskamux ! filesink location="cedar.mkv"

gst-launch -ve videotestsrc ! cedar_h264enc ! ffmux_mp4 ! filesink location="cedar.mp4"

Tested at 720p/60
